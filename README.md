# Project Todos

A todo app where the user can add tasks, delete tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. It also shows a count of the uncompleted todos. The goal for this project was to learn more about Redux toolkit; how to create slices, create new reducers and actions and also how to work with immutability and how to structure and interact with the store.

## The problem

I started by dividing the code in smaller chunks, for example making a slice and creating a store. Then I created components and fetched the todos so I could see the todos being listed. Then I implemented an action to push news tasks to the list of existing tasks. After setting up the basic logic of the project I styled the page using styled components.
